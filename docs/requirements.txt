# The ordering of these requirements can matter. It matters if we install them
# in an environment where a dependency to them (such as sphinx) is
# pre-installed, such as it can be on RTD. For example, if a top-ordered package
# declares it needs sphinx>=1 and then a later package declares it needs
# sphinx<4 - the latter may be ignored.
#
# As long as we have myst-parser ordered before other sphinx depending packages,
# we should be good.
